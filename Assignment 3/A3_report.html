        <p>Insights about the data/visualization:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The spiral design effectively aligns the same months of different
            years along the same half-axis, which makes it easier to compare
            case trends across corresponding time periods. This design helps
            users recognize patterns and seasonal recurrences more intuitively.
          </li>
          <li>
            The visualization reveals that COVID-19 cases surge most
            significantly in winter, particularly following the December
            holidays. This suggests that factors such as increased indoor
            gatherings and holiday travel contribute to higher transmission
            rates, potentially overwhelming individual immunity and accelerating
            the spread of the disease.
          </li>
          <li>
            The widening spiral visually emphasizes the sharp increase in cases
            from 2020 to 2022. This reinforces the impact of new variants,
            changes in immunity levels, and shifting public health responses
            over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            The use of a 7-day moving average helps highlight broader trends by
            reducing short-term volatility in case numbers. This makes it easier
            to distinguish long-term waves from daily noise, allowing viewers to
            focus on meaningful patterns rather than being distracted by
            fluctuations in case reporting.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Design Critique:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            This spiral visualization is visually striking and effectively
            conveys the magnitude and recurrence of COVID-19 surges. However, it
            has several drawbacks that limit its clarity and impact. The spiral
            layout, while unique, lacks a sense of urgency that a public health
            crisis demands. The soft red shading and smooth curves give the data
            an artistic appearance rather than emphasizing the severity of the
            outbreaks. Additionally, while the design highlights seasonal
            trends, it sacrifices the ability to make direct comparisons of case
            counts across different time periods. A standard line chart, for
            instance, would offer a clearer and more intuitive view of peaks and
            troughs over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another issue is the distortion caused by the radial layout. Some
            months appear stretched, making them seem longer or more significant
            than others, which can mislead viewers about the duration and
            intensity of each wave. This effect, combined with the lack of
            numerical markers beyond the single 150K reference point, makes it
            difficult to extract precise values. Adding labels for key peaks,
            minima, or even additional reference lines could improve readability
            and provide better context. While the spiral format effectively
            emphasizes seasonality, a more traditional time-series chart would
            likely offer more precise insights into the rate of increase and
            decline for each wave, making it a better tool for data-driven
            decision-making.

        </figure>

        <p>Design Rationale for Sketch 1:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I went with a standard time-series line chart because it gives a
            much clearer view of peaks and troughs over time. This directly
            fixes the readability and comparability issues from the spiral
            design, making it easier to track when cases were rising or falling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Instead of mapping data along a warped radial path, I laid it out in
            a way that maintains consistent spacing between months. This
            eliminates the issue of distorted time perception while preserving
            seasonality, making it much easier to compare year-over-year trends
            without visual bias.
          </li>
          <li>
            I also added annotations for key events, like the Omicron outbreak,
            so it’s obvious when external factors contributed to major case
            spikes. This helps restore the sense of urgency that was lost in the
            spiral’s smooth curves—sudden surges now stand out, making it clear
            when outbreaks were accelerating or slowing down.
          </li>
        </ul>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Rationale for Sketch 2:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I went for a bar chart because it simplifies year-over-year
            comparisons while preserving the seasonal patterns seen in the
            original spiral. By aggregating data into seasons, I removed the
            noise of month-to-month fluctuations and instead focused on the
            bigger picture: how outbreaks aligned with colder months and holiday
            seasons.
          </li>
          <li>
            I intentionally chose warm and cool colors to match the feel of each
            season—cool blue for winter, fresh green for spring, warm orange for
            summer, and earthy brown for fall. This not only makes the chart
            visually appealing but also reinforces the seasonal groupings at a
            glance, helping viewers intuitively associate trends with different
            times of the year.
          </li>
          <li>
            I added a partial outline around the 2022 bars to subtly separate
            the seasons without breaking the overall flow of the graph. This
            keeps things organized and makes it easier to read across different
            seasons without bars blending into each other.
          </li>
        </ul>

        </figure>

        <p>Design Rationale for Sketch 3:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I wanted to keep the cyclical nature of COVID-19 waves but fix the
            issues from the original spiral design. Instead of a continuous
            curve, I structured the data into concentric rings, with each ring
            representing a different year. This makes it easier to compare the
            same months across different years without distortion, while still
            emphasizing how outbreaks followed seasonal patterns.
          </li>
          <li>
            The yellow-to-deep-red gradient effectively highlights case
            severity, making major surges immediately visible. The structured
            circular layout helps track recurring outbreaks, and the even
            spacing of months ensures no single time period looks exaggerated.
            The reference legend also helps translate color into case counts,
            making the data more interpretable at a glance.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the design successfully conveys seasonality, precise case
            values are still hard to extract. Adding numerical labels or key
            event annotations (like Omicron’s peak) could provide more context.
            I’d also explore thicker gridlines or subtle radial guides to
            further improve readability, and possibly test a logarithmic color
            scale to better differentiate between moderate and extreme case
            counts.

        <h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

        <p>
          This final design came after multiple iterations where I tried to
          balance clarity, seasonality, and meaningful context. I started off
          with the spiral visualization, which was great for emphasizing the
          cyclical nature of COVID-19 waves, but I quickly realized it distorted
          time and made direct comparisons between waves difficult. I then
          experimented with bar charts for seasonal aggregation and radial
          heatmaps to keep the cyclical aspect while improving readability, but
          those didn’t do a great job of showing the precise timing and scale of
          case surges. Eventually, I landed on a time-series line and area chart
          hybrid, which gives a clean, structured view while still preserving
          big-picture insights.
        </p>

        <p>
          The stacked area chart for new cases helps show the sheer scale and
          duration of each wave, while the red line chart for new deaths makes
          it easy to compare infection waves with their fatality impact. I also
          wanted to bring back the seasonality aspect that got lost in standard
          time-series charts, so I added subtle background shading for each
          season, using colors that intuitively map to the time of year. This
          helps reinforce the idea that certain seasons—especially winter—saw
          repeated surges. Another big improvement was adding vertical reference
          lines to mark major events like the first U.S. lockdown, vaccine
          approvals, and major variant peaks. These provide much-needed context
          for why some waves were more severe than others. I also used different
          line styles to distinguish policy-related events from variant-driven
          peaks, making it clear what type of event each reference line
          represents.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since raw daily case numbers can be pretty noisy, I used a 14-day
          moving average to smooth things out and highlight longer-term trends.
          I also paid close attention to the axis scales to make sure both cases
          and deaths could be shown without one overshadowing the other—hence
          the dual-axis setup, which makes it easier to see how deaths lag
          behind case surges. The color scheme took a few tries to get right. I
          originally considered using a simple diverging scale but ended up
          layering gradients for seasonality while using bold, distinct colors
          for reference lines to reinforce the key takeaways. The deep blue for
          case trends keeps them visually dominant, while the red death trend is
          clear without being overpowering. Looking at the final result, I think
          this design does a solid job of balancing detail with readability,
          making it both informative and easy to interpret.
        </p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <p>
          This final design successfully addresses many of the critiques I had
          about the original spiral visualization while also revealing new
          design challenges along the way. One of the biggest weaknesses of the
          spiral was that it distorted time, making it difficult to directly
          compare case counts across different waves. This time-series format
          eliminates that issue by presenting trends in a structured, linear
          way, allowing for much clearer comparisons between different periods.
          The spiral also lacked clear contextual markers, which made it harder
          to interpret why certain surges occurred. I resolved this by adding
          vertical reference lines for major pandemic milestones, such as
          lockdowns, vaccine rollouts, and variant peaks, providing a
          much-needed link between policy interventions and case trends.
          Additionally, the dual-axis setup improves readability, making it
          easier to compare case surges and deaths without one overshadowing the
          other.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, working through this redesign process also reinforced that
          some critiques are harder to fully resolve. One challenge was
          maintaining the emphasis on seasonality without introducing
          unnecessary complexity. The spiral format naturally conveyed
          cyclicality, whereas a standard time-series chart does not. To address
          this, I added seasonal shading in the background, but this also made
          the chart look a bit busier than I originally intended. I experimented
          with alternative ways to encode seasonality, such as separate seasonal
          averages or statistical breakdowns, but these disrupted the overall
          flow of the time-series design. This was the best balance I could find
          between keeping the focus on trends while still showing the recurring
          seasonal patterns. Another limitation is that while this version
          improves precision, it still prioritizes trends over exact numerical
          comparisons, meaning it might not be ideal for someone looking for
          more statistical detail. Still, this process reinforced how every
          design decision—whether it’s color, layout, annotations, or axis
          formatting—shapes the way data is understood. In the end, while not
          every critique could be perfectly addressed, this final version
          significantly improves on the clarity, comparability, and contextual
          depth that were missing in the earlier designs.
