        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Creating a Restrictiveness Index and Grouping into Percentiles
              (Score: +2):</strong
            >
            I identified five key factors that impact access to abortion clinics
            (e.g., clinic closures, provider density, travel rates), normalized
            these measures, and then computed a weighted average to form an
            access restrictiveness index. Here, accessibility refers to how
            easily residents can obtain abortion services, while restrictiveness
            captures the extent of policy barriers limiting access. I divided
            the index into eight percentile groups, from “Most Accessible” to
            “Most Restrictive”, to capture subtle differences across states.
            This decision is data-driven and transparent, which makes my
            visualization persuasive because it reflects a nuanced understanding
            of policy impacts. I considered using fewer groups, but settling on
            eight allowed for a more detailed narrative.

              >Filtering Out Outliers That Contradicted the Trend (Score:
              -1):</strong
            >
            I filtered out outlier states that fell outside the interquartile
            range (IQR) in the bar chart, as these states did not follow the
            overall trend of lower in‐state abortion rates with increased
            restrictiveness. This filtering helped clarify the downward trend
            and strengthened the persuasive message, although it does omit some
            valid data points. I weighed the alternative of including all data,
            but including these outliers would have muddled the pattern I was
            trying to emphasize.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Title Implication of a “Divide” (Score: +0.5):</strong>
            I opted for a title that subtly hints at a “geographic divide,”
            linking clusters of policies (for example, a more restrictive South)
            to the observed outcomes without directly claiming causation. This
            decision helps make my visualization persuasive by drawing attention
            to regional differences while staying technically accurate. I
            considered a neutral title like “Policy Distribution by State,” but
            that alternative would have lacked the persuasive impact I was
            aiming for.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Color Choices (Score: +0.5):</strong>
            I selected a red-to-blue gradient for the map visualization to
            differentiate levels of policy restrictiveness. Using red to
            indicate more restrictive policies and blue for more accessible ones
            leverages familiar political color associations, making the map
            immediately understandable and persuasive. This approach worked well
            in drawing attention and providing clarity, though I acknowledge
            that these colors may also evoke certain emotional responses. I
            considered a neutral, single-hue palette, but the red-to-blue scheme
            was ultimately more effective at communicating the intended message.

              >Averaging Rates Without Weighting by Population (Score:
              -1.5):</strong
            >
            I calculated average in‐state abortion rates without adjusting for
            state population sizes. This decision means that small states with
            extreme values (like Wyoming) can disproportionately affect the
            averages, reinforcing the narrative that restrictiveness correlates
            with lower in‐state abortion rates. Although using weighted averages
            would have offered a more balanced view, I chose the unweighted
            method because it better supports the persuasive argument I was
            making, despite its limitations.

            Restrictive States Rely More on Out-of-State Abortion Access (2020).
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <li>
          <strong
            >Using 100% Stacked Bars to Emphasize Proportional Dependency
            (Score: -1):</strong
          >
          I chose a 100% stacked bar chart to illustrate the proportion of
          in-state versus out-of-state abortions, thereby spotlighting how much
          each group relies on external access. By adding the absolute counts
          for each segment, I reinforce the point that states in more
          restrictive categories aren’t necessarily experiencing fewer total
          abortions—they’re just pushing them elsewhere. I considered using a
          dual-axis chart (counts plus proportions), but that would have been
          more complex and less direct in conveying the argument that
          restrictiveness shifts, rather than reduces, abortions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Weighted Averages for Out-of-State % (Score: +2):</strong>
          I applied a weighting scheme based on each group’s total abortion
          volume so that populous states (e.g., Texas) carry more influence than
          smaller states (e.g., Wyoming). This approach offers a more realistic
          depiction of the broader impact, making the argument more convincing:
          when large states have higher out-of-state percentages, it’s a clear
          sign of displacement. I considered using simple averages, but that
          would let small outlier states skew the results.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Low-Contrast Color Encoding for Out-of-State Segments (Score:
            -0.5):</strong
          >
          I opted for a subdued purple shade for out-of-state abortions, which
          slightly underplays their prominence. While this choice helps keep the
          visualization from feeling too confrontational, it also risks
          diminishing the apparent magnitude of out-of-state reliance. I briefly
          considered a bold, contrasting palette but felt it might overshadow
          the data, so I stuck with a softer approach that still highlights the
          displacement narrative.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Title Framing (“Rely More”) to Undermine the Proposition (Score:
            +1):</strong
          >
          I used the phrase “Rely More” in the title to shift the interpretation
          from “restrictive laws reduce abortions” to “restrictive laws push
          abortions out of state.” This directly challenges the idea that fewer
          in-state procedures indicate fewer overall abortions, instead
          suggesting that people are simply forced to seek services elsewhere. A
          neutral title like “Out-of-State Abortion Rates” would have been less
          persuasive for an against-the-proposition viewpoint.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Ordering Groups from Most to Least Restrictive (Score:
            +1.5):</strong
          >
          I arranged the bars so that groups become more restrictive from left
          to right, creating a clear progression showing how out-of-state
          reliance increases with policy stringency. This mirrors the layout of
          the For visualization, making it easy to compare how the same data can
          support an opposing argument. I considered sorting by total abortion
          volume, but decided that emphasizing restrictiveness directly was more
          impactful for highlighting the displacement effect.

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>
          Throughout this process, the initial step of identifying key data
          points, such as in-state versus out-of-state abortions and the factors
          that contribute to the restrictiveness index, seemed clear at first,
          even though the dataset didn’t explicitly provide these figures. I
          invested a significant amount of time working through calculations and
          mathematical formulations to derive the necessary metrics. In
          contrast, striking the right balance between persuasion and honesty
          proved much more challenging. I quickly assembled the pro chart, but
          when I turned to the against chart, every calculation I attempted
          still supported the original proposition. To overcome this, I shifted
          my perspective and subtly redirected the audience’s attention to a
          related narrative, one that emphasizes how restrictive policies
          displace abortions rather than reduce overall demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decisions like filtering out outliers, selecting specific color
          schemes, and framing titles with emotive language pushed the
          boundaries of what felt like a fair representation of the data. I was
          surprised by how a minor tweak, such as removing just a few outlier
          states, could radically alter the perceived trend. I also dedicated
          significant effort to refining the title and color scheme to ensure
          the focus shifted appropriately. This experience underscored how even
          small design choices can powerfully shape a narrative.
        </p>
        <p>
          I now define “ethical analysis and visualization” as the practice of
          being transparent about design decisions and fully acknowledging their
          impact on the audience’s interpretation. There is a fine line between
          acceptable persuasive choices, such as emphasizing a particular trend
          with a clear, data-backed rationale, and misleading ones, like
          distorting axes or omitting significant contradictory data without
          explanation. In my view, an acceptable approach conveys the data’s
          fundamental truth, while a misleading one obscures it. Ultimately,
          acknowledging and documenting the motivations behind each design
          decision is essential for maintaining ethical standards, even when the
          objective is to persuade.
