    <h3>Dataset: Residential sales data in the City of Boston, 2000-2023</h3>
    <p>
      The dataset contains information on residential property sales in Boston
      from 2000 to 2023. It includes details on sale prices, buyer and seller
      types, property characteristics, and whether a sale qualifies as a flip.
    </p>
    <h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Where is investor activity most concentrated?</strong>
      </li>
      <p>
        The MAPC report shows how corporate and absentee buyers tend to cluster
        in certain areas, pushing up prices and making it harder for long-term
        residents to stay. I want to map out where this is happening in Boston
        and see if these hotspots line up with rising costs and displacement.

          >How does ownership structure vary by property type and style?</strong
        >
      </li>
      <p>
        The “Reckoning with Boston’s Towers of Wealth” article points to
        high-rise condos and multi-family properties as prime targets for
        investors. I want to see if that holds true in Boston.
      </p>

      <li>
        <strong>What kinds of properties are flipped the most?</strong>
      </li>
      <p>
        ProPublica’s research on private equity in real estate suggests that
        investors focus on properties that can be quickly renovated and resold
        for a high profit. I want to find out which property types in Boston are
        most frequently flipped and whether that’s making certain segments of
        the market less affordable.
      </p>

      <li>
        <strong>How have property prices evolved over time?</strong>
      </li>
      <p>
        The MAPC report suggests that investor-heavy areas tend to see faster
        price spikes, making housing less accessible. I want to track how
        property values have changed over time and whether areas with lots of
        speculation have experienced sharper increases compared to other parts
        of the city.
      </p>

      <li>
        <strong>When and where has flipping been most intense?</strong>
      </li>
      <p>
        After the 2008 financial crisis, investor activity surged as distressed
        properties became easy targets. I want to see when and where flipping
        has been the most common in Boston, whether certain neighborhoods have
        been repeatedly targeted, and how these trends align with broader market
        shifts.
      </p>

        <h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
        <p>
          Before diving into speculation trends, I first need to understand the
          shape and structure of the dataset. I started by mapping out where
          investor activity is concentrated and then drilled down into ownership
          trends, flipping patterns, and how these dynamics have shaped property
          prices in Boston over time.
        </p>

          />
          <figcaption>
            One of the biggest questions I had going into this analysis was
            whether investor activity is concentrated in certain areas and if
            those areas align with rising costs and displacement risks. To get a
            sense of where real estate activity is happening, I mapped the
            density of property transactions across Boston. The reder areas show
            neighborhoods where properties are changing hands the most, but this
            alone doesn’t tell the whole story. High transaction volume could
            mean strong demand from residents, or it could point to
            investor-driven turnover that might be pushing up prices and
            reducing housing stability.

          <img
            src="Visualizations/where_owned.png"
            style="width: 100%; height: auto"
          />
          <figcaption>
            To dig deeper, I looked at corporate and absentee
            ownership—properties owned by investors, landlords, or non-resident
            buyers. The second map makes it clear: investor activity is heavily
            concentrated downtown and in transit-accessible areas. This makes
            sense since these locations promise high rental demand and strong
            price appreciation, making them attractive to investors. But this
            also raises concerns. In other cities, corporate ownership has been
            linked to rising rents and lower homeownership rates, and Boston may
            be following the same path. If corporate investors continue to
            dominate these areas, affordability could become an even bigger
            issue, especially for renters and first-time buyers trying to enter
            the market.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="Visualizations/who_owns_types.png"
            style="width: 100%; height: auto"
          />
          <figcaption>
            After identifying where investors are most active, I wanted to see
            what types of properties they’re targeting. This chart breaks down
            ownership by property type, and the pattern is clear—apartments and
            commercial properties are overwhelmingly investor-owned, while
            single-family homes are still mostly owned by individuals. Investors
            tend to go after multi-unit properties because they generate rental
            income and allow for greater scalability, while single-family homes
            are more often purchased as primary residences. This suggests that
            much of Boston’s rental housing stock is controlled by corporate
            owners, which could make it harder for local buyers to find
            affordable housing options.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="Visualizations/who_owns_styles.png"
            style="width: 100%; height: auto"
          />
          <figcaption>
            The next chart looks at ownership by architectural style, and it
            reinforces this trend. High-rise and contemporary buildings are
            mostly investor-owned, while older styles like Colonials and
            Duplexes remain largely in the hands of individuals. This tells me
            that investors are especially interested in newer developments,
            particularly condos, which are often marketed as investment-friendly
            assets rather than primary residences. If this trend continues,
            Boston’s new housing stock could be shaped more by investor
            priorities than by the needs of long-term residents.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="Visualizations/styles_flipped_most.png"
            style="width: 100%; height: auto"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Flipping is one of the clearest signs of short-term speculation, so
            I wanted to see which property types and styles are flipped the
            most. This chart shows that townhouses, rowhouses, and duplexes have
            the highest flip rates, which makes sense—these properties tend to
            be older, relatively easy to renovate, and located in desirable
            neighborhoods. There’s also noticeable flipping in condos and
            apartments, meaning speculation isn’t limited to single-family
            homes; investors are active in multi-unit properties as well.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="Visualizations/types_flipped_most.png"
            style="width: 100%; height: auto"
          />
          <figcaption>
            The next chart breaks down flipping by property type, and what
            stands out is that land and industrial properties have the highest
            flip rates. This suggests that some investors aren’t just focused on
            renovating and reselling homes—they’re also betting on redevelopment
            opportunities. On the other hand, flipping rates for single-family
            homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial properties are
            relatively low, likely because these properties are more valuable as
            long-term rental assets than as quick-flip investments.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="Visualizations/changed_over_time.png"
            style="width: 100%; height: auto"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Another key concern in this analysis is whether investor activity
            has contributed to rising housing costs. The multi-line chart
            reveals a consistent upward trend in property prices for highly
            flipped property types, with significant spikes around 2006–2007 and
            2019–2020. These surges coincide with major economic shifts, such as
            the pre-financial crisis and pre-pandemic periods, when changes in
            lending policies and broader economic conditions made it easier for
            investors to enter the market. In future research, I plan to further
            examine flipping activity across different variables to better
            understand its correlation with these price spikes.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="Visualizations/most_common.png"
            style="width: 100%; height: auto"
          />
          <figcaption>
            To analyze how flipping patterns have evolved over time, I mapped
            its concentration across five-year periods. In the early years
            (2000–2004), flipping activity was scattered and relatively diffuse.
            However, between 2010 and 2015, it became highly concentrated in
            specific neighborhoods, particularly in the city's dominant real
            estate markets. This trend aligns with the post-2008 financial
            crisis recovery, when investors capitalized on distressed
            properties, renovating and reselling them for profit.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="Visualizations/flip_rate.png"
            style="width: 100%; height: auto"
          />
          <figcaption>
            This chart illustrates the distribution of flipped properties by
            type over time. One striking observation is the spike in
            single-family residences flipping in 2009, likely a response to the
            aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Another key trend is the
            significant rise in commercial property flips in 2010, which may
            indicate a shift in investor focus toward income-generating assets
            during the early recovery phase. Over the years, residential
            condominiums and apartments have remained a steady presence in the
            flipping market, suggesting that multi-unit properties continue to
            attract investor interest.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="Visualizations/where_most_flipped.png"
            style="width: 100%; height: auto"
          />
          <figcaption>
            This graph shows the total number of flipped properties per year.
            Flipping remained relatively low before 2010, but there was a sharp
            surge beginning in 2011, peaking between 2013 and 2015. This spike
            aligns with the post-2008 recovery period when investors capitalized
            on low property prices and favorable market conditions. After 2016,
            flipping activity gradually declined but remained significant,
            showing a resurgence in 2021 and 2022, possibly driven by market
            shifts following the COVID-19 pandemic. The dominance of residential
            condominiums in flipping trends suggests that multi-unit properties
            have consistently been a key target for investors.

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>
          This report analyzes Boston's residential property sales from 2000 to
          2023, using visualizations to examine investor activity, ownership
          structures, flipping trends, and price changes. Findings show that
          corporate and absentee ownership is concentrated in downtown and
          transit-accessible areas, driving up prices and reducing
          affordability. Investors primarily target high-rise condos and
          multi-family properties, while single-family homes remain largely
          individually owned. Flipping is most common in townhouses, rowhouses,
          and duplexes, with notable speculation in condos. Prices have steadily
          risen, with spikes in 2013–2014 and 2019–2020 aligning with investor
          activity. Flipping peaked post-2008 before declining but remains a
          market force. The analysis highlights investor-driven speculation as a
          key factor in price volatility and housing instability.
